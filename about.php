            <p>Eats&Reast was founded in 1988 by a local Toronto based family. We opened our first location in March of 1989, the whole family worked long hours to make things work. The concept was simply to create a cosy environment that was well suited to have great conversations, served quality freshly cooked meals and offered great draft beer and spirit selections. After more than three decades of fine-tuning, product development, and loads of hard work, we have what you see today. We serve over 40,000 people a week in our 13 Toronto locations.
            Today, we are defined as a mainstream casual dining restaurant with an integrated sports bar area that caters to the community and local businesses. We provide friendly, attentive service in a relaxed environment and prepare everything fresh on site.</p>

            <p>Over the years our menu has changed to reflect today’s consumers. From a once beer and wing joint to our current menu of over 50+ items including our hand-dipped to order authentic beer-battered fish & chips, premium brisket burgers, made to order Chicken tenders, fresh-cut Ontario source potatoes for our fries, a great selection of entree salads and more than 20 vegetarian options. Let’s not forget that we still serve great wings, and let not forget we even make our own salsa from scratch on site.
            We offer delivery using our OWN delivery service right here on our website, we also use third party delivery apps (but they take a LOT from us…). The overall decor of Gabby’s has also evolved over the years. Once a Roadhouse looks, now a much softer, cleaner, more contemporary casual dining look. Our latest locations feature generously padded banquettes, the walls offer rich wood finishes, natural stone and exposed brick topped with a splash of our signature nostalgic signage and conversational pieces. A host of large High Definition Flat Screen TV’s, rich earth tone colours and great music round out the theme. Our newest location even has its own liquor store for your convenience. Our image is a reflection of today’s consumer needs.</p>
